# Space-Pong-Game
# I have set the colours like this:
Ball: Red
Paddle: White
Top Panel: Pink
Middle Panel: Dark Gray
Bottom Panel: Black

# Initial speed of the ball:
x direction: 3
y direction: 0

# I have added a game over display 

# Main class has the main method, you do not need any command line argument

# When the play button is pressed game freezes instead of setting the position of the components to their initial position (ball, paddle etc.)

# Time is not 60 seconds but it is 15 seconds per level

# Stellar objects are created randomly but their max Y position is 400 so they are always on top part of the panel. I thought it would make the game 
more fun
